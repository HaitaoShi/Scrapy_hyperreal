Alright guys our mission is to make an informative list of all chemicals, anything you came up with's bioavailability for oral, rectal, IV, IM and intranasal. Alright so lets all do some research and come back and collaborate on what info we have. Ill report back shortly!

All bioavailabilies are relative to IV bioavailability (100% ). For those that do not know, the bioavailability of a substance is basically the percentage of the dose that gets absorbed. It changes drastically for each method of administration. A half-life is the amount of time it takes for your body to eliminate half of the substance that you took. There is a lot of conflicting data on the exact bioavailabilities of each substance so every thing thats listed here is the average. 

Opiates
Methadone: Oral 84%. Elimination half-life:24-36 hours, 
Ketobemiodone: Oral 34% +/-10%; Rectal 44% +/- 9%. Elimination half-life: 2.25- 2.45 hours
Meperidine: Rectal 55%, IM 80-85% Elimination half-life 3.0 h
Buprenorphine: Oral 22%; Sublingual 30%; IM 90-100%. Elimination half-life: 12-44 hours

Alfentanil: 92% Protein binding. Elimination half-life is 1.5-2 hours
Morphine: Oral 30%; Rectal 30%; Intranasal 15-20%, Chitosan(a linear polysaccharide that helps absorb drugs better) has been shown to increase nasal bioavailability of morphine from around 10-20% to over 60%, SC-60%, protein binding 30-40%, half-life is 2-3 hours
Oxycodone: Oral 60-87%; intranasal- 55-70% 
Hydrocodone: Oral bioavailability is not really known but it is around oxycodone bioavailability; Orally 70% of it is usually absorbed, half-life is 4-8 hours

Pethidine(meperidine): Oral 50-60%. Protein Binding 65-75%, Half Life 3-5 hours 
Normeperidine Is about half as potent as meperidine, but it has twice the CNS stimulation effects. 
Pentazocine: Oral 20%. Half-life 2 to 3 hours
